### Continued development

I would like to continue the front-end development, to improve my knowledges in order to be able to create more complex websites. 
Still have issues in correctly structuring a HTML page, to follow the correct flow, the correct semantics. The right one in the right place. 


### Useful resources

-Mozilla Developer https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn - this helped me to understand the structure of a HTML document and to style it using CSS. 
-w3schools https://www.w3schools.com/ - a second really good source to answer your questions regarding HTML and CSS but not only. I am trying to check multiple sources regarding the same question. 


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
